# Transition

This repository is a Python port of S. Baar Matlab code to test
transition probability estimate method on the double well problem.

Of particular interest is the implementation of the trajectory-adaptive multilevel splitting (TAMS).

The original Matlab code is available [here](https://github.com/Sbte/transitions/tree/master/matlab).
