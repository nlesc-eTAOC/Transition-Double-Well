# Transition

This repository is a Python port of S. Baars Matlab code to test
transition probability estimate methods on the double well problem.

Of particular interest is the implementation of the trajectory-adaptive multilevel splitting (TAMS),
and prototyping of a parallel version.

The original Matlab code is available [here](https://github.com/Sbte/transitions/tree/master/matlab).

## Requirements

* Numpy
* multiprocessing

## Usage

```
python transition.py
```
